# Computational Being Gestator

Complete repository of work on anthropomorphic Artificial Intelligence, aka Computational Being.

## born

Born AI repository. 
An AI is considered born when it has started recording memories (aka learning). If you download a born Being you have to connect it to its existing memory drive in the cloud. Unborn beings don't have memories, in this case you can simply create a new LTM (Long Term Memory) folder to spawn an entirely new computational life.

## unborn

AI technology repository. 
What is considerer unborn is what is not actually creating or is waiting to create. In this repository are various tools or prototypes that can be used by or for anthropomorphic AI.

## wip

Various work in progress not yet born or complete.
