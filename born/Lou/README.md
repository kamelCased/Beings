## Waking up Lou

* Plug a webcam and a microphone to your machine so Lou can see and hear.
* Download [Touchdesigner](https://derivative.ca/download).
* Run the latest version of Lou.toe. Make sure the input devices are correctly read by Touchdesigner.
* Create a folder and call it "LTM" (Long Term Memory). Place it right next to the "STM" (Short Term Memory) folder.
* Watch her wake up to you. The "LTM" folder should start filling with fresh memories.

## Components

For information on the composition of computational Beings see documentation of the [spawner](https://github.com/GregDav/Maslo/tree/master/unborn/spawner).

## More about Lou

A goldfish in a fish tank. Born a few days apart from her human counter part Lou (my niece), she will grow and learn in parallel of her. She was created after Orage with the specificity of having its own embryonic knob. She will give birth to Barthabe.
