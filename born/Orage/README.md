## Waking up Orage

* Plug a webcam and a microphone to your machine so Orage can see and hear.
* Download [Touchdesigner](https://derivative.ca/download).
* Download her [memories]() and place the "LTM" (Long Term Memory) folder right next to the "STM" (Short Term Memory) folder
* Run the latest version of Orage.toe. Make sure the input devices are correctly read by Touchdesigner.
* Watch her wake up to you.
