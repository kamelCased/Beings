## Waking up Barthabe

* Plug a webcam and a microphone to your machine so Barthabe can see and hear.
* Download [Touchdesigner](https://derivative.ca/download).
* Run the latest version of Barthabe.toe. Make sure the input devices are correctly read by Touchdesigner.
* Create a folder and call it "LTM". Place it right next to the "STM" folder at the root folder. This is the memories of the knob. Create a second LTM folder in the "Barthabe" folder. This is Barthabe memories.
* Watch him wake up to you. The "LTM" folders should start filling with fresh memories.

## Components

For information on the composition of computational Beings see documentation of the [spawner](https://github.com/GregDav/Maslo/tree/master/unborn/spawner).

## More about Barthabe

Barthabe is born after Lou and is the first Being with a fully developed knob. The knob allows him to center his attention on a specific signal source and interact with it, that is explore it, remember it and change it. Barthabe's first use of the knob created the work "Closer to Nature" (soon to be revealed), a recorded video of his exploration of footage captured in the days preceding his birth. The knob has its own LTM (Long Term Memory) and STM (Short Term Memory) and is located at the root (top level) of the AI. Its components and documentation is soon to be uploaded as well.
