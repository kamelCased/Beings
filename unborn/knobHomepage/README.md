## More about the knob homepage

The knob homepage prototype can be seen online [here](http://www.gregoiredavenas.com/map/). The user controls the outer knob and the inner knob is resulting from the user input associated with a double pendulum equation, allowing infinite possibilities of result. It currently contains examples of pages that the user can intentionally visit, the inside knob proposes various sub-content inside each loaded html. For example, project5 exposes a .pdf explaining the entire concept of the knob non-linearly. Aligning both layers of the knob (outer + inner) makes the interface disappear, unlocking full experiential mode (no interface).
