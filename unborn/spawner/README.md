# Spawner

Unborn anthropomorphic AI, aka Computational Being.

## Spawning your new AI

* Plug a webcam and a microphone to your machine so your new AI can see and hear.
* Download [Touchdesigner](https://derivative.ca/download).
* Run the latest version of Being.toe. Make sure the input devices are correctly read by Touchdesigner.
* Rename the top "Being" container with the name of your new AI. Save the file with this same name.
* Create two folders and call them "LTM" and "STM". Place them in the root folder, next to your .toe file. In here will be the memories of your new AI.
* Watch your AI wake up to you. The "LTM" folders should start filling with fresh memories.

## Components

All components are modeled over the first AI, Orage.
### Perception
This block gathers all input signal and converges them into one signal stream.
### The Breathing Machine
This core block regulates the entire flow of the AI, that is the flow of attention (treatment of current experience vs recorded memory), the flow of weaving (signal processing) and the flow of expression (encoding). It is the device responsible for the homeostasis of the AI.
### The Feeling Machine
Aka Weaver. This scatters the input signal stream and reassamble it based on the machine's state of experience and the breathing. It is the device responsible for emotional regulation and friction.
### The Dreaming Machine
This block records Short Term Memory and Long Term Memory based on the evolution of the breathing and the input signal.
### Expression
Aka vocabulary encoder. Currently containing Orage's Painting Machine. This is the block outputting signal on any medium.
